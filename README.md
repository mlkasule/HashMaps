# HashMaps
1.  Given the following key values,  show what the data structures would look like after insertions 
           27 53 13 10 138 109 49 174 26 24
(no preprocessing necessary:  pk = key)
a. Linear array of 10 elements using division hashing
and the linear-quotient collision path algorithm
N = 13, 4k+3 prime = 19
b. Bucket hashing of 10 elements (N=10) ip = (pk) % N
